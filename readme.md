### Hi there! 😁

My name is Toti Cavalcanti from Brazil. I am a full-stack developer since 2014, creator and maintainer of [Código Fluente](https://www.codigofluente.com.br). I'm passionate about open source projects. I've created some projects as [Front-end BR](https://github.com/frontendbr) and I've always loved to produce a lot of content during my career.

In my free time I like run on the beach, watch movies and series, read books, listen and play music, and eventually I like to philosophize about life.

Would you like to find me?
